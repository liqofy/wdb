<h1>Welcome to Gaborone Senior School, where we build the brightest futures</h1>
<h2>From Form 1 through to A-levels, the Senior School offers a wide range of
 subjects that enable the students to make informed subject choices when the time comes to do so.</h2>

 <p class="city">The school also has an abundance of sporting facilities including soccer fields, tennis and basketball courts, an athletics track, 
    and one of the largest indoor sports halls in Gaborone. 
    On the cultural front, the school is well known for its achievement in debating and chess, 
    while drama and music are growing in prominence.</p>

</p>We partake in numerous international competitions in both Sporting and Cultural fields. 
Our most recent aspiration is to put together a Robotics Team to compete in global competitions..</p>
